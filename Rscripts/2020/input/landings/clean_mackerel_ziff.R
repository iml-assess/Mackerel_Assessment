#####################  QUALITY CHECK  ####################

# Context: - Landings from the Gulf have been slow to come in historically. Gist is that mackerel are lower priority regionally and that the preponderance of purchase slips vs logbooks makes processing slow
#          - At the 2019 mackerel stock assessment, landings data from the Gulf Region was not available at the time of the assessment (impacts on catch-at-age)
#          - Landings data for the Gulf in 2018 was obtained from the Gulf Quota Report page and from communications with their statistics bureau
#          - Landings data for the Gulf region in 2018 and 2020 still not on their quota reports page as of (22/12/2020) but...!
#          - The data are on their Public (drop down menu) page https://inter-j01.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/qr/report/query

# Verify ziff landings vs regional quota reports and from NHQ
